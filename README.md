This is my first boot.dev project :) 

This Python script analyzes a text document and generates a report containing word count and character frequency statistics.

- Calculates the frequency of each character in the document.
- Generates a report displaying word count and character frequency statistics.

## How to Use

1. **Installation:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Clone this repository or download the script file (`main.py`).

2. **Usage:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script (`main.py`).
   - Run the script by passing the path to the document you want to analyze as a command-line argument:
